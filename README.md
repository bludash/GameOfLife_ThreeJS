# What is GameOfLife_ThreeJS?
GameOfLife_ThreeJS is a simple Javascript project to run Game of Life in every modern browser.

GameOfLife_ThreeJS uses Three.js to display a 2D point cloud in a 3D space. Three.js uses WebGL. With the included TrackballControls.js the user can navigate around the 2D plane.

The current release does not include any special code optimizations due to time limitations. But everybody is welcome to contribute and accelerate the output framerate.


# Why did I start this project?
I created this project for evaluating Three.js. What could be the performance of a Three.js powered Game of Life when doing little or no code optimization? What would be the maximum achievable framerate in a fullscreen browser with a resolution at 4K? How stable will this setup be or will it crash regularly?
