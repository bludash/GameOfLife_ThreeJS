# GameOfLife_ThreeJS
I created this project for evaluating Three.js. What could be the performance of a Three.js powered Game of Life when doing little or no code optimization? What would be the maximum achievable framerate in a fullscreen browser with a resolution at 4K? How stable will this setup be or will it crash regularly?
